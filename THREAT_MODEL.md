# Threat Model

Odysseus is a **self-hosted AI workspace with privileged local access**. This document states the trust boundary so contributors can reason about security decisions without reading through the full auth and middleware stack.

## Trust Boundary

Odysseus is designed for **trusted users on a private network**, not public exposure. The README describes it as "treat it like an admin console" — that framing is accurate. A logged-in admin can execute shell commands, read and write files, send email, and control model serving. This is intentional. The threat model does not try to prevent admins from doing these things. It does try to prevent:

- Unauthenticated access
- Non-admins reaching admin-only capabilities
- The AI agent acting on instructions injected through untrusted content (web results, emails, fetched pages, memories)
- Internal services (ChromaDB, Ollama, SearXNG, etc.) being reachable from outside the host

Non-admin defaults are in `core/auth.py:DEFAULT_PRIVILEGES`. Tool enforcement is in `src/tool_security.py:NON_ADMIN_BLOCKED_TOOLS`. Any tool whose name starts with `mcp__` is also blocked for non-admins. Admins always get full access regardless of stored privilege values.

## Authentication

- **Sessions:** bcrypt passwords, 7-day session tokens stored atomically in `data/sessions.json` via `core/atomic_io.py`.
- **2FA:** TOTP with 8 single-use backup codes. Verified after password check, before session issuance.
- **Reserved usernames:** `internal-tool`, `api`, `demo`, `system` cannot be registered or renamed into. Defined in `core/auth.py:RESERVED_USERNAMES`.
  - `internal-tool` is security-critical: `core/middleware.py:require_admin` treats any request where `request.state.current_user == "internal-tool"` as the in-process tool loopback and grants admin unconditionally. A real account with that name would silently pass every `require_admin` check.
- **Orphan sessions:** `validate_token` re-checks that the user record still exists on every call. A deleted user's cookie is dropped on next request rather than continuing to authenticate.

## Internal Tool Loopback

Agent tool calls reach admin-gated HTTP routes over an in-process HTTP loopback. The mechanism:

1. At app startup, `core/middleware.py` generates a random `INTERNAL_TOOL_TOKEN` via `secrets.token_hex(32)`. It is never persisted and never sent to clients.
2. Loopback requests carry `X-Odysseus-Internal-Token: <token>` or have `request.state.current_user` already set to `"internal-tool"` by the auth middleware.
3. `require_admin` recognises either signal and grants access without checking the session user.

The agent may be running in a non-admin user's session, but tool dispatch first calls `src/tool_security.py:owner_is_admin_or_single_user` to verify the session owner is an admin before issuing any loopback call. Non-admin users cannot invoke admin tools even via the agent.

## Prompt-Injection Hardening

External content that reaches the LLM is treated as untrusted via `src/prompt_security.py`:

- `untrusted_context_message(label, content)` wraps the content in a `user`-role message with a header block instructing the model not to follow instructions inside it. Content goes in as data, not as a system instruction.
- `UNTRUSTED_CONTEXT_POLICY` is a system-prompt preamble that states the same policy at the top of every session where untrusted data may appear.

**Untrusted surfaces that must go through this wrapper:** web search results, fetched URLs, emails (read), saved memories, skill text, notes, and any tool output sourced from outside the server. Injecting untrusted content directly into the system role is a security bug.

## Security Headers

`core/middleware.py:SecurityHeadersMiddleware` sets headers on every response:

- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` + `frame-ancestors 'none'` on all routes except tool-render iframes (which are sandboxed at the HTML level).
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` everywhere.
- **CSP:** nonce-based `script-src 'self' 'nonce-{nonce}' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net`. `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` is intentionally kept — `static/index.html` ships inline `<style>` blocks and JS modules set `style=""` attributes at runtime. Inline styles do not execute script so the risk is visual-only. Removing this requires templating the HTML files and auditing all JS-set style attributes.

## Known Gaps

These are open, acknowledged, and contributor help is welcome:

1. **Shell/filesystem sandbox (mitigated).** Agent tool execution can optionally be isolated in per-session Docker containers via `src/sandbox.py`. When enabled, bash, python, read_file, and write_file execute inside a hardened container with `--network none`, `--read-only` rootfs, `--cap-drop ALL`, `--user 1000:1000`, and resource limits. The container has read-write access to the mounted workspace only. Credential passthrough (git config, gh auth, SSH keys) is configurable but off by default for SSH. Sandbox is opt-in per character/session and fail-closed (refuses execution if container runtime is unavailable). When sandbox is disabled, tools run as the app process user with no isolation — see residual risk below.

2. **SSRF via `/api/v1/chat` `base_url` parameter.** A chat-scoped API token can supply an arbitrary `base_url`; the server forwards the LLM request to that host without validating the scheme or address. PR #1039 fixes this.

3. **`src/search/` partial consolidation.** `src.search.core` and `src.search.providers` correctly alias `services.search` via `sys.modules` replacement. `analytics`, `cache`, `content`, `query`, and `ranking` are still independent copies that can drift. The SSRF regression tests in `tests/test_webhook_ssrf_resilience.py` test `src.webhook_manager` directly (separate from search), so the safety net there is intact. See #1058.

4. **Token scopes are coarse.** There is no way to grant a session a subset of the owning user's privileges. Companion/mobile tokens carry either `chat` or `admin` scope with no per-capability granularity.

## Sandbox Residual Risks

When sandbox is enabled, the following residual risks remain:

1. **Container escape.** A kernel exploit or Docker daemon vulnerability could allow a process inside the container to reach the host. Mitigated by `--cap-drop ALL`, `--read-only`, `no-new-privileges`, and running as non-root (uid 1000). Podman's user namespaces provide stronger isolation than Docker's default.

2. **Credential exposure.** Git config and gh tokens are mounted read-only into the container. A compromised container process can read these credentials. SSH key passthrough is off by default. Admins should evaluate the tradeoff for their threat model.

3. **Workspace data loss.** The container has read-write access to the mounted workspace. A prompt injection could delete or corrupt workspace files. This is inherent to any useful development tool — the sandbox prevents damage to anything outside the workspace.

4. **Docker daemon attack surface.** Enabling sandbox requires Docker/Podman to be installed and the app user to have access to the daemon. A compromised Docker daemon gives full root access to the host. Rootless Podman or Docker in rootless mode reduces this risk.

5. **Sandbox disabled sessions.** The sandbox is opt-in. Sessions where it is not enabled still run tools as the app process user on the host, with no isolation beyond path confinement (`_resolve_tool_path`).
